#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software systems. With the use of engineering principles, software engineering ensures reliability, efficiency and scalability of software systems. 
Its role in the technology industry is to provide structured methodologies to design and build high-quality software products/systems that meet both users' and businesses' requirements.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 
1. The "Software Crisis" and the Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
At the NATO Software Engineering Conference (Germany, 1968), experts discussed the "software crisis"—a growing problem of software bugs, delays, and cost overruns.
Edsger Dijkstra criticized unstructured coding, leading to the promotion of structured programming to improve reliability. This crisis prompted the formalization of software engineering as a discipline.
2. Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (1983) – C++
Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ (1983), bringing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to mainstream software development. OOP introduced key principles: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making software reusable and scalable. Later languages like Java (1995) and Python (1991) built on OOP principles.
3. Cloud Computing & DevOps – AWS (2006) and CI/CD
Amazon Web Services (AWS, 2006) introduced cloud computing, changing how software was deployed. Companies moved from on-premise infrastructure to cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. The DevOps movement (2010s) integrated development and operations, with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automating software delivery.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement analysis- gathering and defining system and user requirements.
2. Planning- outlining and understanding project scope, timeline and resources.
3. Design- creating system design and architecture.
4. Implementation- writing code depending on the specifications on design.
5. Testing- identifying and fixing errors and bugs for quality assurance.
6. Deployment- releasing software for use.
7. Maintenance- regularly performing updates and fixes.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is a step by step approach where each phase/step is completed first before moving to the next while agile methodology is an iterative and flexible approach that relies on incremental development and frequent feedback from stakeholders and customers. Waterfall methodology works best for projects with well-defined requirements such as government systems and banking systems, for example. Agile methodology is suitable for dynamic projects such as mobile and web app development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- writes, tests and maintains code to build software systems.
Quality assurance engineer- ensures software accuracy and reliability through performing testing to check if the product meets the requirements.
Project manager- handles project timelines, scope, resources and communication with stakeholders for the required delivery.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, debugging and testing in an easy-to-use application. Some of them include Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA. Version Control Systems enable collaboration and code tracking. Some examples are Git and GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Balancing workloads and deadlines. Can be solved by using project management tools such as Trello and maintaining realistic expectations with stakeholders.
2. Poor communication in teams. Can be solved by regular SCRUM meetings and using collaboration tools such as Slack for better teamwork.
3. Keeping up with new technologies. Can be solved by doing online courses and networking at workshops to be up to date.
4. Managing technical debt. Can be solved by prioritizing long-term maintainability over quick fixes. (ChatGPT)


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- validating and testing a specific feature or behaviour or individual components of code.
Integration testing- ensuring that different components and functions work together.
System testing- validating the entire system's functionality.
Acceptance testing- verifying if the system meets the requirements and everything works as intended.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of writing instructions/queries to guide AI models to produce desired outputs. Prompt engineering is crucial for interacting with AI models because it allows users to precisely guide the AI's response by carefully crafting the input prompts, ensuring the model generates relevant, accurate, and tailored outputs, effectively maximizing the potential of the AI system and mitigating potential biases present in the model itself. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Tell me about food.
Better prompt- Tell me about pilau, the Kenyan meal. and the ingredients and recipe to prepare it.
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides more clarity for the response and narrows the focus to the specific meal. It ensures that the response is more informative and structured.
